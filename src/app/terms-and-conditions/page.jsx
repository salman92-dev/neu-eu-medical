                    If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your
                    concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact info@neueu.co with
                    any dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and
                    inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration.
                    “Disputes” between you and Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss , including its
                    processors, suppliers or licensors or their respective affiliates, agents,
                    directors or employees, are defined for the purposes of these Terms to include
                    any claim, controversy, or dispute (whether involving contract, tort,
                    equitable, statutory, or any other legal theory) between you and Neu Eu Medical

                    to, any claims relating in any way to these Terms (including its breach,
                    termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our relationship, Neu Eu

                    11. Binding Individual Arbitration
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    ‍


                    You and Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration
                    is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more
                    quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral
                    arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court
                    can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL
                    BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND
                    CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING
                    YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
                    ACTION AGAINST NEU EU MEDICAL WEIGHT LOSS . If any provision of this
                    arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no
                    case shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved
                    finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single
                    arbitrator administered by JAMS, according to this provision and the applicable
                    arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose
                    transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to
                    pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through
                    arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If
                    you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family
                    use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish where you
                    reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in Texas, or another
                    mutually agreeable location, or a location ordered by the arbitrator. The
                    arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a
                    judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim
                    for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may recover those
                    fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, Neu Eu
                    Medical Weight Loss

                    <br />
                    <br />


                    will not seek to
                    have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded,
                    unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of
                    this arbitration provision, references to you and Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss


                    <br />

                    also include respective subsidiaries,
                    affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns. Subject
                    to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any
                    judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will
                    be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in
                    the state courts in Texas.

                    Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss may assign all or part of this

                    limited to, the recitals, notices and limitation of liability clauses, shall
                    survive. No waiver of any of these terms shall be deemed a further or

                    agreement or policy, these Terms shall prevail
                    on the subject matter of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is
                    invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and
                    interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
                    extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will

                    PORTAL, GO TO "SUBSCRIPTIONS" ALONG
                    THE TOP MENU, SELECT "MANAGE SUBSCRIPTION" AND "END

                    <br />

                    Your subscription will automatically renew for another
                    subscription period unless you cancel at least two (2) days before the
                    applicable renewal processing date of your subscription. We do not offer
                    refunds for partially used subscription periods, although we may provide
                    refunds on a case-by-case basis in our sole and absolute discretion. We may
                    also offer you the ability to pause your subscription for a specified period of
                    time. If you do not cancel before the end of the pause period, charging to your
                    payment device will resume automatically. We may change our subscription plans
                    and prices from time to time; however, we will provide you advance notice of
                    any price changes or changes to your subscription plans.
                    <br />

                    Unfortunately, we cannot cancel or refund medication
                    shipments after they have been ordered by your provider. This is because the
                    pharmacy has already begun the process of preparing your medication to be
                    shipped to you.
                    <br />


                    NEU EU MEDICAL WEIGHT LOSS, LLC. is not responsible for any orders after
                    <br />

                    they have been shipped from the pharmacy. We cannot issue refunds for medications
                    <br />

                    that have proof of delivery from the carrier.
                    <br />

                    We can re-order your medication but there will be a new charge
                    associated with this order. If you would like to file a lost or stolen package
                    claim you can contact the delivery carrier directly to do so. All medication
                    orders are final once shipped by the Pharmacies and the order cannot be returned
                    or refunded. This is to protect the integrity of the medication and the health
                    of the patient, as well as to comply with applicable laws. However, if you
                    think you have received the wrong medication, have received an order in error,
                    or have any other questions, please contact us at info

                    <br />

                    To ensure uninterrupted Services, we will bill you
                    automatically via the Payment Method for the Services you sign up for, from the
                    date you submit your initial payment and on each renewal period afterwards,
                    until cancellation in accordance with our cancelation policy or until we are no
                    longer offering the service (in which case we will notify you). Your renewal
                    period will be equal in time or amount to the renewal period of your current
                    membership. For example, if you are on a monthly plan, each billable renewal
                    period will be for one (1) month. We will automatically charge you the
                    applicable amount using the Payment Method you have on file with us and by
                    agreeing to these Membership Terms, you authorize us to do this. You can
                    disable auto-renewal at any time by logging into your account and selecting
                    “cancel subscription” or contacting us at

                    You agree and acknowledge that you will be billed
                    automatically regardless of whether or not you have used the Services, unless
                    the Services end or are canceled. You will be responsible for paying all past
                    due amounts. You acknowledge that billing may not occur on the exact same date
                    of each month. If the amount to be charged to you varies from the amount you
                    preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of
                    state sales taxes), for example, due to an increase in the medication pricing,
                    you have the right to receive, and we will provide, a notice of the amount to
                    be charged and the date of the charge at least 30 days before the scheduled
                    date of the transaction. If you do not agree with the new amount in the notice,
                    you may cancel the transaction by logging into your account and selecting
                    “cancel subscription” or contacting us at

                    We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
                    <br />
                    <strong> 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
                    <br />
                    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
                    <br />
                    <strong> 8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong>
                    We collect data from children between the ages of 12 and 18 (“child” or “children”), only if we have permission to do so from the child’s parent or legal guardian. As described in this section and this Privacy Policy generally, we are committed to protecting the privacy of children in connection with the use of our Services and in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) or other applicable state privacy laws. For more information about COPPA, please click here: Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions | Federal Trade Commission (ftc.gov).Our Services include online services that may be used to assist the provision of health care to a child, but only if a parent or legal guardian creates an account on behalf of the child and attests that they have legal authority to do so. Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to register for an account directly and therefore, by using the Services independently, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age. When registering a child for our Services, the parent or guardian will be asked to provide certain information about the child, including their name, birth date, address, email, and password. If the child is under the age of 13, the parent or guardian will also be asked to review and consent to our COPPA Parental Consent form. If the parent or guardian chooses not to consent to the collection and use of their child’s information, they may not create an online account for the child. A parent and guardian may also revoke their consent for us to further collect personal information from their child online by contacting us at info@neueu.co Once consent is revoked, a child may not use any Services online. In addition to the parent or guardian’s right to revoke consent for the collection of the child’s personal information, a parent or guardian may request to review the personal information we have collected from the child or to delete personal information we have collected from the child, subject to our data retention requirements. Please submit your request or any questions to info@neueu.co.

                    <strong> 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>
                    <br />

Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” section below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
                    <br />
                    Ability to Review Account Information
                    <br />
                    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.

                    <br />
                    <strong>  10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
                    <br />
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below. Notwithstanding our policy not to collect information from children under 18, if you are under 18 years of age and reside in California, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

                    <br />

                    What categories of personal information do we collect?
                    <br />
                    We may have collected the following categories of personal information in the past twelve (12) months:
                    <br />
                    Category Examples Collected

                    We may also collect other personal information outside of these categories in instances where you interact with us in person, online, or by phone or mail in the context of:
                    <br />

                    How do we use and share your personal information?
                    <br />
                    More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this Privacy Policy. You may contact us using the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt out we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.
                    <br />
                    Will your information be shared with anyone else?
                    <br />
                    We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf. We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be “selling” of your personal information. Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Neu Eu Medical Weight Loss will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.

                    Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

                    Right to be informed — Request to know
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    whether we collect and use your personal information; the categories of personal information that we collect; the purposes for which the collected personal information is used; whether we sell your personal information to third parties; the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose; the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA. You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
                    <br />
                    To exercise these rights, you can contact us or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.
